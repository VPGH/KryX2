//proxies of any type go here.
//use @http, @s4, and @s5 to specify proxy type.
//ex: 127.0.0.1@http
//if type is not specified the program will try to determine
//type automatically; but it's recommended to specify when possible.
//alternatively, you may use provided files for each type.
//ex: socks 4 proxies would go in ProxiesS4.txt. There is no need to specify
//type when placing proxies in their specific text file.
